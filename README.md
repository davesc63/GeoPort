## Developer Mode

**Developer Mode:** Enable developer mode on connected iOS devices.

They've made it harder to enable Developer Mode, but GeoPort handles it with ease. If you don't have Developer Mode enabled on your iOS device - you will need to temporarily remove your passcode to allow GeoPort to enable Developer Mode (Don't worry, GeoPort will let you know when running the app)
